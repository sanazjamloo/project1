Connect4 project

This game is a in-browser game, and an online version of classic Connect 4 game made in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3.

Objective
Connect four of your tokens, vertically or horizontally, before the other player do so.

How to play
In each turn, drop a token in one of the seven columns. For simplicity, let red always go first.  Play alternates red-blue-red-blue, etc.  A player selects a column by clicking the button at the bottom of that column.  The "checker" goes in the lowest row in that column that is not already occupied.
The game ends either when the board is full (no moves possible) or when one player has four in a row, either horizontally or vertically.
