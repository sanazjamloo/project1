# Connect4 Game

This game is an online version of classic Connect 4 game made with Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3.

#### How to play
In each turn, drop a token in one of the seven columns. For simplicity, let red always go first.  The game alternates red-blue-red-blue, etc. The player selects a column by clicking on a box at the bottom row.  The token will land on a box that is not occupied.
The game ends either when the board is full (no more moves are possible) or when one of the players connect four tokens first, either horizontally or vertically.

### Future Implementations

* diagonal wins
* Player vs. computer
